# guzzle-transcoder

This [Guzzle] plug-in converts documents obtained by Guzzle to UTF-8 using [Transcoder] library. It is largely based on Pascal Landauâ€™s [guzzle-auto-charset-encoding-subscriber] and [web-utility] libraries. Thanks to Transcoder, when mbsting is not available iconv will be used. Additionally we still support PHP 5.4.

## Basic usage

```php
$client = new Client();
$converter = new EncodingConverter();
$sub = new GuzzleAutoCharsetEncodingSubscriber($converter);
$url = 'http://www.myseosolution.de/scripts/encoding-test.php?enc=iso'; // request website with iso-8859-1 encoding
$req = $client->createRequest('GET', $url);
$req->getEmitter()->attach($sub);
$resp = $client->send($req);
```
